  Search engine optimization (SEO) is one of the most important marketing
  tactics for your business. However, few actually know how to do it
  effectively. To help, we’ve put together an entire guide on SEO for beginners,
  which includes how SEO works, why it’s important and how to do it yourself.
  Use this beginners’ guide to rank your website higher in search engines like
  Google for relevant and high-value search terms.

<div className="mt-12">
  <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">What Is SEO?</p>
  <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-8">
    SEO, short for search engine optimization, is the process of improving your website so it ranks higher for organic search terms and increases its visibility. 
    The overall goal of SEO is to generate more traffic for your website to generate more leads and sales. 
    There are three components of organic SEO, which include on-page, off-page and technical SEO.
  </p>
  <div className="mt-6">
    <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
      On-page SEO represents factors directly related to your website’s content, which include things such as blog article quality, meta descriptions, keyword targeting and more. Off-page SEO comprises SEO factors that occur outside of your website, such as your overall backlink volume and quality. Finally, technical SEO represents your website’s overall performance and health, such as your desktop and mobile loading speed.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="mt-6">
    <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
      To rank your website higher for relevant and high-value keywords, it’s important to address all three of these SEO components. With this in mind, let’s discuss exactly how SEO works.
    </p>

<div className="mt-12">
  <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">How Does SEO Work?</p>
  <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-8">
    When someone searches for something on platforms such as Google, those search engines use proprietary algorithms to crawl the internet and rank the most relevant and high-quality content on a search engine results page (SERP). These pieces of content are typically blog articles targeting a specific keyword, but can also include other media types such as images or video.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-8">
    To determine the most relevant results, Google and other search engines will first analyze the search term to understand the user’s overall intent, and then find content that best addresses the user’s query and overall intent based on a blend of on-page, off-page and technical SEO factors.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-8">
    The goal of SEO is therefore to rank higher in SERPs for specific keywords—or queries—that are relevant to your business. To do so, it’s first important to do keyword research to determine which terms you should be targeting. From there, write high-value blog articles that directly address those keywords. Then, promote your content through off-page tactics that build backlinks and make sure your website is optimized to perform well for the user.

  <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">How To Perform SEO</p>
  <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-8">
    While SEO may seem complicated, there is a set of repeatable steps you can follow to execute an effective SEO strategy. These steps include defining your audience, identifying relevant keywords, crafting high-value content, generating backlinks and optimizing your website performance. Let’s take a detailed look at each of these steps:
  </p>
</div>
<div className="mt-12">
  <p className="text-xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">1. Define Your Target Audience</p>
  <p className="text-md text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-4">
    The first thing you want to do is define your ideal audience, which will inform the topics and keywords you’re targeting. You can do this by creating an ideal customer profile or buyer persona that identifies things such as demographics, psychographics, firmographics and more. You can create one manually or use an online tool such as HubSpot’s Make My Persona to help you create one.
  </p>
</div>
<div className="mt-12">
  <p className="text-xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">2. Conduct Keyword Research</p>
  <p className="text-md text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-4">
    With your target audience defined, the next step is to conduct keyword research to identify relevant search terms to target with high-quality pieces of content such as blog articles. The best way to do keyword research is to use a free tool such as Google’s Keyword Planner or a paid option such as Semrush.
  </p>
</div>
<div className="mt-12">
  <p className="text-xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">3. Craft High-Quality Content</p>
  <p className="text-md text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-4">
    The next step is to write and publish quality blog articles each targeting one of the primary keywords on your content runway. To do so, start with an outline that identifies the overall header structure of your article and includes the primary keyword in elements such as the title and relevant headers.
  </p>
</div>
<div className="mt-12">
  <p className="text-xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">4. Build Quality Backlinks</p>
  <p className="text-md text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-4">
    A backlink is a link from a third-party site pointing to your content, which Google views as a measure of authority. Once your blog articles are published, conduct off-page SEO tactics that generate quality backlinks, such as direct outreach. For example, research relevant websites that can benefit from linking to your content. Then, find their contact information and reach out with a suggestion to link to your site.
  </p>
</div>
<div className="mt-12">
  <p className="text-xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">5. Optimize Your Website Performance</p>
  <p className="text-md text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-4">
    Make sure that you’re also improving your website’s overall health and performance, which includes things such as loading speed, mobile optimization and more. Google uses a Lighthouse performance score to rank your website on key performance metrics and assign you a score out of 100. Also included are scores for accessibility, best practices and overall SEO. The goal is to optimize your site to get these four scores as close to 100 as possible.
  </p>

<div className="mt-12">
  <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">Conclusion</p>
  <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-8">
